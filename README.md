# About Me
Hi my name is Jake, I am currently a computer science student at Trent University. I have been programming since I was 7 so around 12 years now, working on a wide range of projects in various different fields. I used to work primarely in the Javascript world on web development and server side development, in 2019 I got hooked on the world of compiler and programming langauge design. Currently I have been working on the [Grain programming langauge](https://github.com/grain-lang/Grain) and designing the next iteration of the [Brisk](https://github.com/spotandjake/Brisk) programming language. I have particular interests in: functional programming, typechecking and designing safe and expressive code.

# Engineering
I was introduced to the world of engineering when I was young and quickly excelled, I used to work primarly in quality control though I have worked through various differnt job positions, projects and companies.

# Brisk
My favoruite project is my uncompleted programming lanauge Brisk. The first iteration has been lost in the sands of time but the goal was to introduce myself to compiler design. The current version in the [Brisk Repo](https://github.com/spotandjake/Brisk) is the 2nd major iteration, it is heavily inspired by Typescript and compiles directly to webassembly. I have big plans on the horizon as I plan on rewriting the entire project from scratch in Grain with a focus on learning about academic features such as: hindley-milner typechecking, wasm component model, and concurrent compiler design, the end goal will be a language similar to Grain but with a combination of abstractions that make it more expressive, reduce abstraction and ride the line between correctness and features.
